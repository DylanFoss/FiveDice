# FiveDice
 A simple command line game of "Five Dice", a.k.a Yatzhee (other dice based games are avaliable.)
 
 This will only work on MS Windows, as it uses windows libaries.

## Overview
Created back in June 2021 to mess around with the windows consoles to make lightweight ascii game, this being my first attempt.

Supports up to 4 players locally.

## CONTROLS:

arrow keys up and down to move through menu options.

ENTER to select currently highlighted menu option.

SPACE to roll the dice.

numbers keys 1-5 to "hold" and "unhold" dice to save between rolls.

Players roll 5 dice up to 3 times and then get to select from multiple scoring combinations for their rolled dice. After every scoring combination has been exhausted, the game ends and all points are counted. Highest score wins.
